- **API**: RESTful endpoints for thread management, message sending, and retrieval

[2025-07-03 12:30:00] - Feature-Driven Frontend Architecture

- **Decision**: Organized frontend code by business features rather than technical layers
- **Rationale**: Better maintainability and team collaboration for complex business logic
- **Impact**: Clear separation of concerns with features/Dashboard, features/Messages, features/ProjectManagement
- **Structure**: Each feature contains components, services, and tests in dedicated directories

[2025-07-02 09:20:00] - MySQL with Migration-Based Schema Management

- **Decision**: MySQL as primary database with comprehensive migration system
- **Rationale**: Relational data requirements with foreign key relationships and data integrity
- **Impact**: Version-controlled schema changes in /api/migrations/ directory
- **Backup**: SQLite compatibility for development and testing environments

## Technical Implementation Decisions

[2025-07-13 00:25:00] - Code Quality Zero-Tolerance Policy

- **Decision**: Maintain zero diagnostic issues across entire codebase
- **Rationale**: High code quality prevents bugs and improves maintainability
- **Impact**: All ESLint warnings and Sourcery optimizations addressed immediately
- **Tools**: ESLint + Sourcery + Vitest for comprehensive quality assurance

[2025-07-10 11:30:00] - Component Memoization Strategy

- **Decision**: Implement React.memo and useMemo for performance-critical components
- **Rationale**: Optimize rendering performance for complex UI interactions
- **Impact**: LiquidGlassWrapper and other components use memoized configurations
- **Performance**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves user experience

[2025-07-08 14:15:00] - Dual-Server Development Environment

- **Decision**: Concurrent Vite (5173) and PHP (8000) servers with proxy configuration
- **Rationale**: Optimal development experience with modern frontend tooling and PHP backend
- **Impact**: Seamless API integration with automatic path rewriting
- **Configuration**: Vite proxy maps /api/* to PHP server with path stripping

[2025-07-06 16:20:00] - Role-Based Access Control Architecture

- **Decision**: Comprehensive role system with Admin, Client, Freelancer permissions
- **Rationale**: Business requirements demand granular access control
- **Impact**: Database-level and API-level permission checking
- **Implementation**: Foreign key relationships ensure data integrity across user roles

## Security & Performance Decisions

[2025-07-12 13:45:00] - Input Validation and SQL Injection Prevention

- **Decision**: Prepared statements exclusively with comprehensive input sanitization
- **Rationale**: Security best practices for database interactions
- **Impact**: All API endpoints use PDO prepared statements
- **Additional**: Input validation on both frontend and backend layers

[2025-07-09 10:30:00] - Password Security with Bcrypt

- **Decision**: Bcrypt password hashing with appropriate cost factors
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for secure password storage
- **Impact**: All user passwords stored with secure hashing
- **Configuration**: Cost factor optimized for security vs. performance balance

[2025-07-08 15:20:00] - File Upload Security Strategy

- **Decision**: Type validation and secure storage paths for all file uploads
- **Rationale**: Prevent malicious file uploads and unauthorized access
- **Impact**: Files stored outside web root with controlled access via API endpoints
