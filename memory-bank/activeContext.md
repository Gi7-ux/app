## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Glass Morphism**: Committed to liquid-glass-react for consistent Apple-inspired aesthetics
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens provides optimal security/UX balance
- **Database Design**: Comprehensive foreign key relationships ensure data integrity
- **Development Setup**: Dual-server approach (Vite + PHP) optimizes development experience

### UX/UI Decisions
- **Component Variants**: Six glass morphism variants cover all use cases (primary, secondary, card, button, navigation, modal)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive liquid glass effects
- **Performance**: Memoized configurations prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance considerations in design system

### Architecture Decisions
- **Feature-Driven Structure**: Organized by business features for maintainability
- **Service Layer**: Centralized AuthService for authentication logic
- **Protected Routes**: HOC pattern ensures secure route access
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user feedback patterns

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Component Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance for flexibility
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization
- **Service Pattern**: Centralize business logic in service classes
- **Testing Strategy**: User-centric testing with @testing-library/react

### Code Quality Standards
- **ESLint Configuration**: Strict linting rules with zero warnings policy
- **Component Structure**: Consistent PropTypes and displayName for all components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic and comprehensive README files

### Security Practices
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization on all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements exclusively
- **Token Security**: Short-lived access tokens with secure refresh token rotation
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission checking at API and UI levels

**2025-07-13 00:31:04**: Comprehensive active context update reflecting current project state, recent achievements, and strategic priorities for continued development.
